*   **Customizable Categories:** Tailor your news feed by selecting the topics that matter most to you. (Feature in progress - example only).
*   **Clean and Intuitive UI:**  Navigating the news has never been easier with our user-friendly design.
* **Offline Reading:** Save articles for later and access them even without an internet connection. (Feature in progress - example only).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):**  Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed (version 11 or higher recommended).
*   **Android Studio:** For building and running the Android app.
*   **Xcode:** For building and running the iOS app.
*   **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin:** It can be installed in Android Studio.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd DailyDigest
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project's Git repository.)

2.  **Open in Android Studio:** Open the root project directory (`DailyDigest`) in Android Studio.

3. **Build Gradle:** Let gradle sync and download all of the dependencies.

4.  **Building for Android:**
    *   Select the `androidApp` run configuration.
    *   Click the "Run" button (green play icon).

5.  **Building for iOS:**
    *   Open the `/iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
    *   Select your target device or simulator.
    *   Click the "Run" button (play icon).

## Project Structure

The project is organized using a standard Kotlin Multiplatform structure, which allows for maximum code sharing between Android and iOS. Here's a breakdown:

*   **`/composeApp` (Shared Code):** This directory houses all the shared code that powers both the Android and iOS apps.
    *   **`/composeApp/commonMain`:**  Contains the core logic, data models, and UI elements that are shared across all platforms. This is where the majority of your shared business logic resides.
    *   **`/composeApp/androidMain`:**  Contains Kotlin code specific to the Android platform. For example, platform-specific implementations of services or APIs can be placed here.
    *   **`/composeApp/iosMain`:**  Contains Kotlin code specific to the iOS platform. For example, if you need to use an iOS-only framework like CoreCrypto, you would put the code interacting with that in here.
*   **`/androidApp` (Android-Specific):** Contains the Android application code. This is the entry point for the Android app and is responsible for starting the shared UI.
*   **`/iosApp` (iOS-Specific):**  Contains the iOS application code, including the necessary entry point and any SwiftUI views that are not shared. This is also the place for iOS specific libraries and code.

## Technology Stack

*   **Kotlin Multiplatform:**  For writing shared code that targets multiple platforms.
*   **Compose Multiplatform:**  For building a shared UI that runs on both Android and iOS.
*   **Kotlin Coroutines:** For asynchronous programming and managing concurrent operations.
* **Ktor:** For networking operations.
